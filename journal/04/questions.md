# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | synchronous executes tasks sequentially and asynchronous executes independently (getting info from the api ) |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | enables an application to respond to specific events or actions that occur during its execution.  |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Transfer

  > | higher order functions take in one or more functions and returns a function as a result

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | its an object that represents the failire or successful completion of an async operation  |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | GET POST PUT  |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface|

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | you have to make the function async  |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | to bundle data and the methods that operate on that data into an object |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |
