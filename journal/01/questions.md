# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > |It allows for collaboration, organization, and accountability for devlopers. The time stamp feature helps with acountability for students and coworkers while the program itsself lends itsself to a collaborative enviroment for sudents and coworkers alike. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | it is used to create a directory|

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, (I got that from google). I am not entirely sure how this class will benefit me but I'm sure that I will use it moving forward.|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element. (google answer)  
    
    from my understanding, specificity refers to the order of operations of the CSS class. It proves that how you style your CSS sheet matters because how it is read is greatest to least importance depending on the tags. This once again proves that regardless of how you approach a coding project, it matters how you style it. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | you could get really messy with what is important and what isnt important. Its crucial to be aware of what youre labeling because every second of your time counts when looking at notes.  |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | If I understand the question correctly, CSS is the style sheet, h1 defines the class that the style sheet is expanding on, and the color is the direction for the color of the text of H1. |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | One word: simplicity. Less is always more. If you style a webaite correcttly then you will engage the customer/viewer and keep them on the page. If you clutter and confuse the client/customer then you can turn them off to not only the website but also what service youre offering |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | it is a process for desigtners to build the barebones for a project. You can show the wireframe to a potential client for them to determine the viability of your proposed project. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | It is important for anyone that is trying to sell their service to show the potential client what thier strategy is. Wireframing can provide the laymans version of a more complex vision to a client that allows them to make a concise decision moving forward. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > |From (google) It encompasses the  flex-items, so if the container's item is not a flex-item, the flex property will not affect the corresponding item.

|

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. |
