# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was surpised the way that I was able to pick up some of the concepts this week. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I knew before hand that I should take things slow but I didnt realize that the entirety of software engineering is problem solving. Which I love and I am excited to continue this journey. 
- What are you struggling with? I am just struggling with the slowing things down part. 
If you take things piece by piece you can accomplish anything. This is something ive struggled with forever and im glad im learning this in the first week.
- What would you count as a victory? being able to complete the labs individually and with coworkers.
